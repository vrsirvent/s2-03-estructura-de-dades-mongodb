**Description** MongoDB data structure
Level 1 - Exercise 1 and 2

Learn how to model NoSQL databases. 
MongoDB structure containing the solution.

An optician, called "Culo de Botella," wants to computerize the management of customers and eyeglass sales. 

First, the optician wants to know who the supplier is for each pair of glasses. Specifically, they want to know the following for each supplier: 
Name, address (street, number, floor, door, city, zip code, and country), telephone number, fax number, and tax ID number. 

For the glasses, it wants to know: The brand, the prescription for each lens, the type of frame (floating, plastic, or metal), 
the color of the frame, the color of each lens, and the price. 

For customers, it wants to store: The name, postal address, telephone number, email address, and date of registration. 
When a new customer arrives, store the customer who recommended the establishment (provided that someone has recommended it). 
Our system will have to indicate which employee sold each pair of glasses. Define the day/time of the sale. 

## Exercise 1

Imagine that we have the following graphical interface, from the point of view of an optician's customer. How would you design the database 
to provide the information?

## Exercise 2

What if the point of view were from the glasses interface?
